	"You are having trouble adding. Your mom shows you a drawing of two dark-colored objects on a white sheet of paper. You counts three objects: left is black, middle is white, and right is black. You can tell that your mom is getting frustrated. You don't understand why and it hurts your feelings. She notices and gives you hug. You feel better, but still very confused.",
	"Today as school, you accidently went into the girls bathroom. You didn't notice until a girl screamed. As you run away from the restroom, you cried your apologies. Turning the corner, you bump into Mary, a good friend of yours. Nervously, you talk about what just happened. As you speak, you realize that the restrooms are different. Puzzled, you stop mid-way in your speech and walk away. While in deep introspection, you remember that you still need to pee.",
	"High school is finishing up. You don't know what college to attend, where you're living, how you're going to pay for the tution and fees, you don't know what to study...You feel overwhelmed with all the choices you have to make. You feel alone and anxiety is your only friend...but you remember...you're not alone and you can do it. ",
	"Its another day writing lesson plans for your students. As you write, you ask yourself: why is it important that I write my plans? Your thoughts go astray and you feel upset. You text your coworker complaining about the lesson plans. Your coworker replies with no sympathy. He says that there is value in planning and there is value in diverting from your plans. This is part of creative processing. You dont reply, but mediate on his words.  ",
	"You're hiking at Angels Landing in Zion National Park in Utah with your wife. Inevitably, you are lost. Thankfully, you kept a map of the park in your backpack. Examining the map, you feel more frustrated. Mary consoles you by rubbing your shoulder. She suggests to turn around and go back. You refuse to turn around. You throw the map away for its lack of usefulness. It was desgined horribly. Who thought oragne and white looked good together?"

	"1 + 1 = 3 or more. A notion developed by Josef Albers who describes this design fault as noise. This noise is directly proportional to the contrast in value between figure and ground. A primitive example is shown below. The two dark objects are joined close enough that the human eye beings to perceive a third object inbetween.",
	"The Dada movement began in 1916 as a reaction to World War I. It was anti-art and radically leftist. During this time Marcel Duchamp exhibited a piece called The Fountain that took the world by surprise. It was a a urinal that he bought from a company. Many criticize the piece saying that it was offensive and not art (since he did not physically create the object himself). This piece is considered a ready-made (found object), an everyday object selected and designated as art.",
	"Hypertext is text that contains links to other text. George Landow, a pioneer of hypertext, argues that the nature of hypertext blurs the edges between reader and writer. Landow says that the reader becomes active because they need to make a choice and act upon the choice by selecting a word or an image.",
	"Jon Kolko emphasis the importance of Synthesis during the Process of Design. He separates the notion into three chasms. The first chasm attemps to make meaning out of data. The second chasm explores expereince and perspective with the newly allocated data. The third chasm looks at the information with an empathy. All of this with the hope of creating meaningful relationships amoung information.",
	"Edward Rolf Tufte talks about the importance of layering infromation. Layering information can help present large amounts of information coherently and semantically. Strategies include changing the tone, color, and weight of text, create labels that stand out from the data, utilizing color among different sections of data, and avoid over-use of ink in graphs or tables."
