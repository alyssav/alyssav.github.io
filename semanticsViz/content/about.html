      <h3> about :</h3>
      this program was created with the hopes of guiding users to making a decision on what model of camera to purchase. sometimes you dont need the most expensive camera on the market to take some great photos. cameras are tools to photographers...just like a painter uses paints and brushes as their tools...while you do need quality equipment, in the end, its the artist's job to be creative, innovative, and passionate about their work in order to produce photos that might have some meaning (for themselves or anyone else). 
      <br><br>
      the data used in this program is from 100k flickr photos. the data was parsed and sorted by tags, number of favorites, and camera type.

      <h3> types of camera bodies : </h3>
       - DSLR (digital single lens reflex)
     <br> - Point and Shoot
      <br> - Phone
      <br><br>
      DSLRs provide the most flexability and functionality. you can manually adjust the camera's ISO, shutter speed, aperature, etc. these features are most useful for people who are interested in taking more control in the outcome of their photos. besides having control, there more room for changing lenses, adding filters, external communication with mobile flash devices, etc. they're still usable by users who do not desire to learn and just want to take pictures. the down side is the weight and price of these devices.
       <br><br>
      Point and Shoot cameras are as simple as the name implies. these cameras a suitable for people who do not want to learn much about how to take photos manually. for those who are curious, some of these cameras do provide a "manual mode". they're usually lightweight and not very expensive. some of these bodies are providing the ability to interchange lenses, making them inbetween a point and shoot and a dslr in terms of camera types.
      <br><br>
      Phones nowadays carry a camera on their back. its very convenient to carry around for most people. there is little to no manual features as you'd expect in a DSLR, but these cameras are improving year to year.
